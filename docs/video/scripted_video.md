# Scripted Video Generation Endpoint (v1)

## 1. Overview

The `/v1/video/scripted` endpoint is part of the Video API and enables the generation of story-driven videos from natural language scripts. It combines stock footage, synthesized voiceovers, and automatic captioning to create professional-quality videos. The endpoint utilizes stock media APIs (Pexels, Pixabay), edge-tts for voice synthesis, and the existing captioning service to generate the final video.

## 2. Endpoint

**URL:** `/v1/video/scripted`
**Method:** `POST`

## 3. Request

### Headers

- `x-api-key`: Required. The API key for authentication.

## 5. Error Handling

The endpoint handles the following common errors:

- **Missing or Invalid Parameters**: If any required parameters are missing or invalid, a 400 Bad Request error is returned with a descriptive error message.
- **Invalid Aspect Ratio**: If the provided aspect_ratio is not one of the supported values, a 400 Bad Request error is returned.
- **Stock Media API Error**: If there's an error fetching media from stock APIs, a 500 Internal Server Error is returned.
- **Voice Synthesis Error**: If there's an error generating the voiceover, a 500 Internal Server Error is returned.
- **Internal Server Error**: If an unexpected error occurs during video generation, a 500 Internal Server Error is returned with an error message.

## 6. Usage Notes

- The `script` parameter supports natural language text with paragraphs. Each paragraph is treated as a separate scene in the video.
- Supported aspect ratios:
  - `16:9` (1920x1080) - Standard landscape format
  - `9:16` (1080x1920) - Vertical video format
  - `1:1` (1080x1080) - Square format
- When `add_captions` is true, the system uses the same caption generation service as the `/v1/video/caption` endpoint.
- All caption styling options from the `/v1/video/caption` endpoint are supported through the `caption_settings` parameter.
- Videos are automatically scaled and cropped to match the requested aspect ratio while maintaining visual quality.
- Stock media is automatically selected based on keywords extracted from the script.
- Voice synthesis uses edge-tts, supporting multiple languages and voices.

## 7. Video Source Priority

The service follows this priority order when selecting video for each scene:

1. Custom video URL (if provided in custom_media for that scene)
2. Stock video from Pexels API matching scene keywords
3. Stock video from Pixabay API matching scene keywords
4. Custom placeholder video (if placeholder_url is provided)
5. Default placeholder video from environment configuration
6. Raises error if no video source available and use_placeholder is false

## 8. Common Issues

- **Resource efficiency**: The video processing is optimized using direct FFmpeg operations, making it more resource-efficient and reliable on servers with limited resources.
- **Long scripts**: Very long scripts may result in longer processing times. Consider breaking them into smaller segments.
- **Stock media limitations**: Some specific or niche topics may have limited stock media options. Use custom_media or placeholder_url for better control.
- **Voice synthesis quality**: Voice quality may vary depending on the selected voice and language.
- **Queue limitations**: If the maximum queue length is reached, requests may be rejected.
- **Placeholder videos**: Ensure placeholder videos are MP4 format and compatible with the desired aspect ratios.
- **Custom media URLs**: URLs must be directly accessible and return MP4 video content.

## 9. Best Practices

- Keep script paragraphs concise and focused for better scene transitions.
- Test different voices to find the best match for your content.
- Use the webhook_url parameter for long videos to avoid timeouts.
- Review stock media keywords in your script to ensure relevant visuals.
- For time-sensitive content, consider pre-generating videos during off-peak hours.
- Monitor and optimize API usage to avoid queue length limits.
- Prepare high-quality placeholder videos that match your brand style.
- Use custom_media for critical scenes where specific visuals are required.
- Test placeholder videos with different aspect ratios before deployment.
- Consider caching frequently used placeholder videos for better performance.
